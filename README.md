# 🧠 Student Score Analysis with Python

This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Python's data science libraries. The aim is to gain insights into patterns and factors that might affect students' academic scores.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset of student scores, this project explores:

- Descriptive statistics
- Data cleaning
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Insights into trends and potential predictors of student performance

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `student_scores.csv`, which includes student performance metrics (such as test scores, attendance, etc. — update this based on actual columns).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


📈 Sample Analysis

The notebook includes:

- Summary statistics of the dataset

- Missing value analysis

- Correlation heatmap

- Visual analysis of score distributions

💡 Insights

Some key takeaways (based on analysis — modify as per findings):

- Students with higher attendance tend to score better.

- There is a positive correlation between study time and scores.

- Subject-wise performance varies significantly.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add predictive modeling using machine learning (e.g., regression)

- Include more features such as socio-economic background or extracurricular activities

- Build an interactive dashboard
